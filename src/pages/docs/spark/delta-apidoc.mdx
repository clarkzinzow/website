# <DeltaLake /> API reference

For most read and write operations on Delta tables, you can use <ApacheSpark />
[reader and writer](/spark/latest/dataframes-datasets/index.md) APIs. For
examples, see [\_](delta-batch.md) and [\_](delta-streaming.md).

However, there are some operations that are specific to <DeltaLake /> and you
must use <DeltaLake /> APIs. For examples, see [\_](delta-utility.md).

{" "}
<Info title="Note" level="info">
  Some <DeltaLake /> APIs are still evolving and are indicated with the
  **Evolving** qualifier in the API docs.
